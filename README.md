## Google OAuth login

This app uses Google OAuth for login. You need a secret key for the Google Apps
API, which the app will load automatically from a file named `.env` in the root
directory. We can't commit the keys to GitHub; ask your PM for these. I sent out
the contents of `.env` over Slack. -- Spencer
