## Google OAuth login

This app uses Google OAuth for login. You need a secret key for the Google Apps
API, which the app will load automatically from a file named `.env` in the root
directory. We can't commit the keys to GitHub. I sent out the contents of
`.env` on the Slack `#general` channel. You can create that file in the root
dir and forget about it; I put it in `.gitignore` so it won't be committed.
